# Progress Log

## Learnings
(Patterns discovered during implementation)
- CustomTkinter uses `ctk.set_appearance_mode("Dark")` before creating app instance
- Window config goes in `__init__`: title(), geometry(), minsize()
- Grid layout configured with `grid_rowconfigure` and `grid_columnconfigure`

---

## Iteration 1 - US-001: Project scaffolding and app window
- What was implemented: Basic CustomTkinter app structure with 900x700 window, dark theme, title, and minimum size constraints
- Files changed: main.py (already existed with correct implementation), requirements.txt (dependencies: customtkinter, pillow, platformdirs)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - The initial code was already well-structured following CustomTkinter best practices
  - Use `ctk.set_appearance_mode()` and `ctk.set_default_color_theme()` before creating the app instance
  - Grid layout with weight=1 makes content expand to fill window
